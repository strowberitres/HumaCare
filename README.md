# HumaCare
HumaCare Web System is a web-based administrative management platform designed to support efficient data handling and system oversight. The system follows the Model–View–Controller (MVC) architecture, ensuring organized code structure, scalability, and easier maintenance.

The platform implements full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing administrators to manage records efficiently and securely. It is designed primarily for admin use, focusing on data accuracy, accessibility, and streamlined workflows.

In addition to the web system, HumaCare includes a mobile system to extend accessibility and support on-the-go usage. The project is hosted on HelioHost, utilizing its file manager for deployment and maintenance.

HumaCare Web System was recognized for its innovation and implementation, earning 3rd Runner-Up in the CCS Start-Up Battle held at the University of St. La Salle.

Note: This repository does not contain the final deployed version of the system. The live version is managed directly through the HelioHost File Manager, and this repository serves as a reference for the system’s structure and development.
